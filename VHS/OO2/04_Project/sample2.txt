This is a collection of relatively large files. While most compression methods can be evaluated satisfactorilly on smaller files, some require very large amounts of data to get good compression, and some are so fast that the larger size makes speed measurement more reliable. New files can be added to this collection.

Note: New files can be added to this collection,
so the overall average for the collection should not be reported as a benchmark.
Results on this corpus should be reported for individual files, or a subset should be identified. Existing files in the collection will not be changed or removed.
